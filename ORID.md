**Objective:** Today, we engaged in pair programming to tackle practical exercises and enhance collaborative problem-solving skills. We also practiced designing and implementing Restful APIs, using real-world examples to solidify our understanding of API development and integration.

**Reflective:** collaborative

**Interpretive:** Working in pairs highlighted the value of shared perspectives and mutual learning. The Restful API exercises provided clarity on structuring endpoints and managing data flows, making the concepts more tangible and applicable.

**Decision:** I aim to further explore Restful API design in future projects and continue leveraging pair programming to improve both my technical skills and teamwork dynamics.
